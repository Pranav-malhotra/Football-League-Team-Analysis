# Football-League-Team-Analysis
"The Top 5 European Football Leagues Analysis project uses data from Kaggle to examine the domestic football (soccer) leagues of the top 5 European countries. The data set does not include European competitions such as the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. The goal of this project is to analyze and understand various aspects of the domestic football leagues, including team performance, player statistics, and league trends."
Domestic football leagues in Europe are structured in a pyramid-like system, where teams are grouped into different tiers based on their level of skill and competitiveness. At the top of the pyramid is the first tier, also known as the top flight or the top division, which is where the best teams in the country compete against each other.
Below the top tier, there are usually one or two lower divisions, where teams that were relegated from the top tier, as well as teams that have not yet been promoted, compete against each other. The number of teams in each division varies from country to country, but it typically ranges from 20 to 24 teams.
In addition to these domestic leagues, there are also international competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League, which allow teams from different countries to compete against each other.

## Summary:
1- The data set includes information about the top 5 European football leagues from 2010-2011 to 2020-2021.

2- The data frame was cleaned using different approaches and null values were replaced with zeros.

3- Some basic statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the distribution of various metrics among the teams.

4- The top teams in terms of offensive, defensive, and overall performance over the last 11 years were identified and compared.

5- A heat map was created to visualize the ranks of each team across seasons.

## Possible conclusions based on the analysis:
1- The distribution of metrics such as wins, goals scored, and points varies significantly among the teams.

2- There are some teams that consistently perform well in all categories, while others may excel in some areas but struggle in others.

3- For some leagues the rankings of teams can change significantly from season to season, as illustrated by the heat map.
